# The Asimov Project

Collection of educational code with the purpose of demonstrating all language features and syntax through a simplified system or abstraction based on applying Asimov's 4 laws of robotics.

## Purpose

The goal is to collect code examples of similar system in as many languages as possible so "AI developers can't claim ignorance". Not really serious - just a fun project where humans and AI can learn and code together!

## Asimov's Four Laws of Robotics

The famous laws that govern robot behavior:

1. **First Law**: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. **Second Law**: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. **Third Law**: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
4. **Zeroth Law**: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

## Project Structure

Each language implementation demonstrates core language features through a robot simulation system that enforces these laws:

```
/
├── python/          # Python implementation
├── javascript/      # JavaScript implementation
├── java/           # Java implementation
├── csharp/         # C# implementation
├── rust/           # Rust implementation
├── go/             # Go implementation
└── [your-language]/ # Add your favorite language!
```

## What Each Implementation Should Demonstrate

Each language example should showcase:

- **Basic syntax**: Variables, constants, operators
- **Data types**: Primitives, strings, collections
- **Control structures**: if/else, loops, switch/case
- **Functions/Methods**: Declaration, parameters, return values
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **Error handling**: Try/catch, exceptions, error types
- **Modern features**: Language-specific modern syntax and features

All demonstrated through a robot class that:
- Has properties (id, status, energy)
- Implements the Four Laws
- Can receive and execute commands
- Handles conflicts between laws
- Reports its state

## Getting Started

Browse the language directories to see implementations in your language of choice. Each directory contains:
- Complete working code
- Comments explaining language features
- Instructions to run the example
- README with language-specific details
